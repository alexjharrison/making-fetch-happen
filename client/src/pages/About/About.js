            <p className='about-text'>
              My husband and I adopted our first dog, a Shiba Inu, Llewey, about
              ten years ago, followed quickly by his brother Bran. A year and a
              half later, we added a foster-fail, Mrs. Moo, to our family.
              Needless to say, my pack needed a lot of training and enrichment,
              which is how we ended up training at the MSPCA.

              In 2015, I began to volunteer at the MSPCA, which is where I fell
              in love with training and behavior. Over the next three years, I
              traveled around the country, attending as many classes and
              seminars as I could from the greats including,{' '}

              <a href='http://animalbehaviorclinic.net/'>Dr. Chris Pachel</a>,
              Ken Ramierz, and many more. I also completed the Applied Behavior
              Analysis curriculum through the Florida Institute of Technology (a
              far cry from my Classics degree from Smith College).

            <p className='about-text'>
              I also began to regularly deploy as a partner responder to
              shelters run by ASPCA and the The Humane Society of the United
              States, where I helped care for different populations of dogs
              ranging from dogs confiscated in dog fighting cases to the{' '}
